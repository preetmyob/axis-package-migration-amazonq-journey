# Central Package Management Migration Plans

ðŸ“– **For the complete guide and overview, see the [main README](../README.md) at the repository root.**

This directory contains four different approaches to documenting the Central Package Management migration process, based on our successful migration of the Axis platform from packages.config to Central Package Management.

## Available Formats

- **structured-guide/**: Comprehensive markdown guide with step-by-step methodology
- **runbook/**: Operations-focused runbook with execution phases and validation
- **knowledge-base/**: Problem-solution reference with error code catalog
- **hybrid/**: Combined approach serving both quick reference and detailed learning

## Migration Success Summary

Our migration achieved 95%+ completion with all major blocking errors resolved:
- Fixed 50+ projects with package reference issues
- Resolved architectural problems with ManagedLzma and other packages
- Addressed compatibility issues across .NET Framework 4.8 projects
- Created reusable automation scripts for future migrations

## Usage

Each folder contains a complete migration plan. Review all four to determine which approach best fits your team's needs, or combine elements from multiple approaches.
