# Central Package Management Migration - Complete Guide Collection

## Overview

This collection documents the complete Central Package Management (CPM) migration process based on the successful migration of the Axis platform from packages.config to Central Package Management. The migration achieved **95%+ completion** with all major blocking errors resolved across 50+ projects.

## Migration Success Summary

### Key Achievements
- **Error Resolution:** Systematically resolved 6 major error categories
  - NU1103: Unable to find package (architectural issues)
  - NU1605: Package downgrade conflicts (version management)
  - NU1202: Framework compatibility issues
  - NU1010: Missing package definitions
  - MSB4062: Duplicate assembly attributes
  - NU1506: Duplicate package versions

- **Package Management:** Successfully centralized management of 100+ unique packages
- **Build System Integration:** Maintained TeamCity build compatibility with NuGet 5.4.0
- **Automation:** Created reusable scripts for future migrations

### Critical Learnings
1. **Architectural Approach:** Pre-release packages (like ManagedLzma) require direct assembly references
2. **Version Strategy:** Transitive dependencies often require higher versions than initially specified
3. **Framework Compatibility:** .NET Framework 4.8 requires specific package versions (e.g., FluentAssertions 5.x)
4. **Build System Considerations:** TeamCity NuGet version limitations affect CPM support
5. **Systematic Resolution:** Prioritizing error types (blocking → build issues → warnings) is crucial

## Automation Scripts (`scripts/`)

### Analysis Tools
- **build-log-analyzer.py**: Extract and categorize errors from TeamCity logs
- **package-version-extractor.py**: Generate Directory.Packages.props from existing packages
- **migration-validator.py**: Validate migration completeness and quality

### Automation Tools
- **batch-project-updater.py**: Apply bulk changes to .csproj files
- Operations: remove-package-versions, add-generate-assembly-info, remove-package, add-property

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Analyze build logs for error patterns
python scripts/build-log-analyzer.py --directory ~/Downloads/build-logs

# Extract package versions from current solution
python scripts/package-version-extractor.py --directory ./src --output Directory.Packages.props

# Remove Version attributes from all PackageReference elements
python scripts/batch-project-updater.py --operation remove-package-versions --directory ./src

# Validate migration completeness
python scripts/migration-validator.py --directory . --output validation-report.txt
```

## Migration Strategy Recommendations

### For Large Solutions (50+ projects)
1. Use **Runbook** for project planning and team coordination
2. Use **Knowledge Base** for real-time troubleshooting
3. Leverage automation scripts for bulk operations
4. Plan for 2-4 weeks of iterative fixes

### For Medium Solutions (10-50 projects)
1. Start with **Hybrid Guide** for quick assessment
2. Use **Structured Guide** for detailed execution
3. Use scripts for validation and bulk fixes
4. Plan for 1-2 weeks of focused work

### For Small Solutions (<10 projects)
1. Use **Hybrid Guide** quick start approach
2. Reference **Knowledge Base** for specific issues
3. Manual fixes may be faster than scripting
4. Plan for 2-3 days of work

## Error Resolution Priority Matrix

| Priority | Error Codes | Impact | Approach |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| 1 (Blocking) | NU1103, NU1605, NU1202, NU1010 | Build failure | Immediate resolution required |
| 2 (Build Issues) | MSB4062 | Build warnings/failures | Address after blocking errors |
| 3 (Warnings) | NU1506, NU1008 | Non-blocking | Address for completeness |

## Real-World Solutions from Axis Migration

### ManagedLzma Package (NU1103)
**Problem:** Pre-release package not found in standard feeds
**Solution:** Reverted to direct assembly reference
```xml
<Reference Include="ManagedLzma">
  <HintPath>..\..\packages\ManagedLzma.0.2.0-alpha-6\lib\net20\ManagedLzma.dll</HintPath>
</Reference>
```

### AWS SDK Version Conflicts (NU1605)
**Problem:** Transitive dependencies required higher versions
**Solution:** Updated to compatible versions
```xml
<PackageVersion Include="AWSSDK.Core" Version="3.7.300.11" />
```

### FluentAssertions Compatibility (NU1202)
**Problem:** Version 6.x not compatible with .NET Framework 4.8
**Solution:** Used framework-compatible version
```xml
<PackageVersion Include="FluentAssertions" Version="5.10.3" />
```

### Assembly Attribute Conflicts (MSB4062)
**Problem:** Auto-generated attributes conflicted with SharedAssemblyInfo.cs
**Solution:** Disabled auto-generation
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <GenerateAssemblyInfo>false</GenerateAssemblyInfo>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## Team Collaboration Guidelines

### Communication Strategy
- Share migration timeline and approach with stakeholders
- Provide regular progress updates with error count metrics
- Establish clear escalation path for blocking issues
- Document all decisions and workarounds

### Code Review Process
- Focus reviews on package version choices and compatibility decisions
- Require build success validation before approval
- Document reasoning for non-obvious changes
- Use incremental commits for easier troubleshooting

### Change Management
```bash
# Recommended commit message format
git commit -m "CPM: Fix NU1103 errors - revert ManagedLzma to direct reference"
git commit -m "CPM: Resolve NU1605 conflicts - update AWS SDK versions"
git commit -m "CPM: Add missing PackageVersion entries for test packages"
```

- [ ] Package versions are secure and up-to-date
- [ ] Directory.Packages.props is well-organized

### Process Validation
- [ ] Migration timeline met
- [ ] Team knowledge transfer completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Automation scripts tested and documented
- [ ] Rollback procedures validated

## Future Maintenance

### Ongoing Activities

- **Dependabot:** Automated dependency updates
- **NuGet Package Manager:** Visual Studio extension for package management
- **dotnet outdated:** CLI tool for finding outdated packages
- **OWASP Dependency Check:** Security vulnerability scanning

## Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Guide:** Select the format that best matches your team's experience and project size
2. **Run Analysis:** Use scripts to understand current state and identify challenges
3. **Plan Migration:** Estimate timeline based on project complexity and error patterns
4. **Execute Systematically:** Follow chosen guide with regular validation checkpoints
5. **Validate Success:** Use migration validator to confirm completeness

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Migration taking too long?** Focus on blocking errors first, warnings can wait
- **Specific package problems?** Check knowledge base error reference
- **Build system issues?** Verify NuGet version and cache configuration
- **Team coordination challenges?** Use incremental commits and clear communication
