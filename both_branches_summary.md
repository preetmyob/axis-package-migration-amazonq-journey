# Axis Package Reference Migration - Both Branches Complete

## ✅ **BOTH MIGRATIONS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

I have successfully created package reference migrations for both branches as requested, using an efficient approach that avoided redoing all the work.

## What Was Accomplished

### Efficient Migration Strategy
Instead of redoing everything from scratch, I:

1. **Updated the repository** to get latest changes from both master and develop
2. **Created new worktree** from develop branch: `trees/package-reference-migration-develop`
3. **Copied migration assets** from the master worktree:
   - `Directory.Packages.props` (centralized package management)
   - `convert_projects.py` (automated conversion script)
   - Documentation files from `.q/` folder
4. **Applied same conversion process** to develop branch
5. **Committed and pushed** the new branch

### Results Summary

| Branch | Projects Converted | Worktree Location | Branch Name |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Master** | 55 projects | `trees/package-reference-migration` | `feature/q-preet-package-ref` |
| **Develop** | 57 projects | `trees/package-reference-migration-develop` | `feature/q-preet-package-ref-develop` |

### Key Differences Between Branches
- **Develop branch had 2 additional projects** to convert (57 vs 55)
- **Develop includes latest changes** (11 commits ahead of master)
- **Same migration strategy applied** to both branches
- **Identical package versions** maintained across both branches

## Branch Status

### Master Branch Migration
- ✅ **Branch**: `feature/q-preet-package-ref`
- ✅ **Status**: Committed and pushed
- ✅ **Projects**: 55 converted
- ✅ **Ready for**: TeamCity validation

### Develop Branch Migration  
- ✅ **Branch**: `feature/q-preet-package-ref-develop`
- ✅ **Status**: Committed and pushed  
- ✅ **Projects**: 57 converted
- ✅ **Ready for**: TeamCity validation

## GitHub Pull Request Links
Both branches are ready for pull request creation:

- **Master**: https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/axis/pull/new/feature/q-preet-package-ref
- **Develop**: https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/axis/pull/new/feature/q-preet-package-ref-develop

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Time Efficient**: Reused existing migration assets instead of rebuilding everything
2. **Consistent**: Same conversion logic applied to both branches
3. **Up-to-Date**: Both branches include their latest respective changes
4. **Parallel Validation**: Both branches can be validated simultaneously via TeamCity
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Can choose which branch to merge first based on validation results

## Next Steps

1. **TeamCity Validation**: Monitor builds for both branches
2. **Choose Primary Branch**: Decide whether to merge master or develop branch first
3. **Address Issues**: Fix any build issues that arise in either branch
4. **Merge Strategy**: Plan how to handle merging both branches

---

**Total Time Saved**: Approximately 1-2 hours by reusing migration assets  
**Total Projects Migrated**: 112 projects across both branches  
**Status**: Both branches ready for validation and merge
